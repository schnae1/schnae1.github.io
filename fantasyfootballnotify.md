## Fantasy Football Notification (Python)

**[** Source Code **](https://github.com/schnae1/projects/tree/master/ffnotify)**

This program logs onto the NFL Fantays Football website, navigates to the dropped player list, checks to see if any players have been dropped within the last thirty minutes and then notifies the user via text message with the list of dropped players.

The program uses Selenium API for navigating the website, Beautiful Soup API to retreive data, and Twilio API to send the text message.
