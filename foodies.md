## Foodies Android App (Java)

**[ ** Source Code **](https://github.com/schnae1/Foodies)**

I’m currently working on this project so it is not yet complete. I my goal is to create a location based app that notifies users of nearby restaurants during the hours that the user would normally eat. The app will make suggestions based on the type of food that the users like.

I’m using Google’s Firebase Authentication API for authenticating user sessions. So far I have created a login or register activity and a user activity once logged in, hat has a button to click to log out.

Right now the app is very basic and is a work in progress.
